	The program implements a simplefied version of DES encryption algorythm
    Given a given string of 8 characters representing 8 bits and a string of 10
    characters representing a 10 bit key.
    Following below steps:
    1)performs an initial permutation of the given plain text:Diffusion

    2)Following the key scheduling process calculates the 8bit key for the
      first round

    3)Then the function process follows below 4 steps to form an output
        a)Expansion of right part of the plain text
        b)expanded text xored with Ki (key of ith round)
        c)S box procedure substitution, Confusion of the text
            also supresses the result back to 4 bits
        d) p4 final permutation Diffusion
        
    4)left side of plaintext is xored with function's result 

    5)left side gets swapped with right side on the first round only. 
	
	Correct Usage:
	Mode 1: Running with no options, the program runs with  default parameters 
           (plaintext:01010001,key:0101001100)

    Mode 2: 2 parameters:
			<8-bit plaintext> <10-bit key>
